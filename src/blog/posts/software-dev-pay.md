Orlando Devs is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit creating education and networking opportunities for software developers in Orlando, FL.

Ever since Orlando Devs started in 2015, smart and passionate members of our community have collaborated in their free time to produce an Annual Developer Salary Survey. The data and insights gained from these surveys are shared with the intent to empower local developer talent with information about developer pay in Orlando.

This year's survey was special to us in more ways than one. For starters, we received more responses than ever from local Central Florida developers! Another reason is that this year we reused all or most of the same questions from the previous year in an effort to create a benchmark for our annual survey. We are excited by the amount of insight we were able to gain from the responses.

Additionally, we look forward to the improvements planned for the survey in 2020. In an effort to better represent our entire developer community, we will be refactoring our survey to conform to changes seen in the developer market in recent years.

Preparing the survey questions, analyzing the data, producing the visualizations, and creating this post was no small feat. It wouldn't have been possible without everyone who contributed, including Matt Burgess, Sergio Cruz, Jorge Hernandez, Jacques Fu, Cassandra Wilcox, Emily Trosper, and probably others that we don't have the names of. We also thank the Orlando Developers community as a whole for always providing amazing feedback and support!

We hope you find the results of the Orlando Developers Salary useful. Enjoy! ðŸŽ‰

## Median Income and Growth

Compared to 2017, we found that median developer income (salaries including bonuses and overtime) increased 16% from $73,000 to $85,000 in our local market in 2018.

Both 2017 and 2018 surveys show that female developers earn less than their male counterparts. And, results from the 2018 survey actually show an increase in the wage gap compared to 2017. Female developers that responded to our survey in 2018 make about $15,000 less than male developers who responded.

## Diversity

1 in 10 developers who responded to the 2018 Orlando Devs Salary Survey identified as female, slightly above other developer surveys like StackOverflow's 2018 Developer Survey which saw 6.9% female, and .9% from non-binary, genderqueer, or gender non-conforming responses.

Here we see a significant increase in Hispanic developers over the 2017 year. We also see a slight rise in Black or African developers. This chart makes us optimistic about diversity amongst our Orlando Devs, but this is one area we would love to see continued growth in diversity.

## Satisfaction

Here we notice a pretty good sign that the majority of developers are happy, with senior devs generally being the happiest. That trend continues to rise for beginner and mid-level developers.
